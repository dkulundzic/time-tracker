# TimeTrackerDomain

Exposes the main building block for the app's business logic. The idea is to fully separate the business logic
into reusable modules, so that any type of UI can be driven of of these reducers. 

I'm using SwiftUI, but we could drive the UI for a Mac app or UIKit-driven app using the business logic types.
